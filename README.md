India_vs_World_COVID19 using Python Machine Learning 

I built a machine learning model using Python to track the spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments worldwide. I showed the different stages of a pandemic and highlighted the crucial role of data scientists in understanding the data and using it to formulate effective strategies.

I used various visualization tools, such as Folium, Seaborn, and Plotly, to plot graphs and maps that helped me analyze trends in countries like India, Italy, South Korea, and Wuhan. I emphasized the importance of early testing and accurate data visualization in deriving meaningful insights.

I used Facebook's forecasting tool, Prophet, to predict the confirmed cases for the upcoming week and worldwide COVID-19 deaths. Overall, I showcased my expertise in machine learning, data visualization, and forecasting by building a model that accurately tracks the spread of COVID-19 and provides valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals.
